- **CSS3** – for styling, layout, and responsiveness  
- **GitHub Pages** – for hosting and live deployment

No JavaScript or frameworks were required for this task.


## Folder Structure
```plaintext
gemcommerce/
├─ images/          # Contains all the image assets used in the page
├─ index.html       # Main HTML file
├─ style.css        # Styling file for the layout and responsiveness
└─ README.md        # Project documentation


## Key Files and Their Roles

### 1. `index.html`
- Acts as the **main entry point** of the website.  
- Structured using semantic elements like `<header>`, `<section>`, `<div>`, and `<footer>`.  
- Divided into logical parts such as:
  - Hero / Introduction
  - Feature or Product highlight section
  - Footer with social or contact info
- Each content block uses class names linked to `style.css` for styling.

### 2. `style.css`
- Handles **typography**, **colors**, **grid layout**, and **spacing**.  
- Mobile-first design: ensures the layout adapts gracefully to different screen sizes.  
- Uses **Flexbox and CSS Grid** for clean alignment and responsiveness.  
- Includes hover effects and spacing utilities for better visual balance.

### 3. `images/`
- Stores all the static assets (icons, product visuals, banners).  
- Images are optimized for faster page loading.
